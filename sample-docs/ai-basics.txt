Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way we live and work. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, which uses neural networks with multiple layers, has achieved remarkable success in image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.

Neural networks are inspired by the human brain and consist of interconnected nodes that process information. The training process involves adjusting the weights of these connections to minimize errors. Backpropagation is a key algorithm used to compute gradients and update weights efficiently.

Recent advances in transformer architectures have led to powerful language models like GPT and BERT. These models can understand context, generate coherent text, and perform various language tasks with minimal fine-tuning. Transfer learning has become a dominant paradigm, allowing models pre-trained on large datasets to be adapted for specific tasks.

The future of AI includes developments in explainable AI, which aims to make model decisions more transparent and understandable. Ethical considerations are increasingly important as AI systems are deployed in critical areas like healthcare, finance, and criminal justice.
