Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational power. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits that can exist in superposition, being both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This property, along with entanglement, enables quantum computers to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers.

Key applications include cryptography, where quantum computers could break current encryption methods, and drug discovery, where they can simulate molecular interactions at unprecedented scales. Optimization problems in logistics and finance also stand to benefit significantly.

However, quantum computing faces significant challenges. Qubits are extremely fragile and require near-absolute-zero temperatures to maintain their quantum states. Error correction is complex, as measuring a qubit causes it to collapse from superposition to a definite state.

Major tech companies and research institutions are racing to build practical quantum computers. IBM, Google, and others have demonstrated quantum supremacy in specific tasks, but general-purpose quantum computing remains years away. The field is evolving rapidly, with new algorithms and hardware designs emerging regularly.
