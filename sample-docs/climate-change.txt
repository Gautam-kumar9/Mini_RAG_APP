Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today. The Earth's average temperature has risen by approximately 1.1°C since pre-industrial times, primarily due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main contributor, accounting for about 75% of emissions.

The effects of climate change are already visible worldwide. Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and severe, and ecosystems are experiencing significant disruptions. Arctic ice is melting at an alarming rate, and many species face extinction due to habitat loss.

Mitigation strategies include transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, improving energy efficiency, and protecting forests that act as carbon sinks. International agreements like the Paris Accord aim to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.

Adaptation measures are also crucial. Communities must prepare for inevitable climate impacts through better infrastructure, water management, and disaster preparedness. Individual actions, such as reducing consumption and choosing sustainable transportation, collectively contribute to addressing this global crisis.
