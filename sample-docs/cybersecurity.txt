Cybersecurity is critical in our increasingly connected world. Cyber threats range from malware and phishing attacks to sophisticated nation-state campaigns. The global cost of cybercrime is estimated to exceed $6 trillion annually, making it one of the greatest threats to businesses and governments.

Defense strategies employ multiple layers of protection. Firewalls and intrusion detection systems monitor network traffic for suspicious activity. Encryption protects data both in transit and at rest. Multi-factor authentication adds an extra security layer beyond passwords alone.

Zero-trust architecture has emerged as a modern security paradigm, assuming no user or system should be trusted by default. Every access request must be verified, regardless of whether it originates inside or outside the network perimeter. This approach helps prevent lateral movement by attackers who breach initial defenses.

Human factors remain the weakest link. Social engineering attacks manipulate people into divulging sensitive information or clicking malicious links. Security awareness training is essential to help employees recognize and respond appropriately to potential threats.

Artificial intelligence is both a tool for cybersecurity and a weapon for attackers. AI can detect anomalies and respond to threats faster than humans, but adversaries also use it to create more convincing phishing emails and evade detection systems.
