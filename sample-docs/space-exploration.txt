The history of space exploration is marked by remarkable achievements and human ingenuity. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong became the first human to walk on the Moon during the Apollo 11 mission. This momentous event fulfilled President Kennedy's goal of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s.

The Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union drove rapid technological advancement. Satellites, space stations, and robotic missions expanded our understanding of the solar system. The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, has provided breathtaking images and invaluable data about distant galaxies.

Modern space exploration involves both government agencies and private companies. SpaceX has revolutionized rocket technology with reusable boosters, significantly reducing launch costs. NASA's Mars rovers, including Curiosity and Perseverance, search for signs of past life on the Red Planet.

Future missions include returning humans to the Moon through the Artemis program and eventually sending crewed missions to Mars. The James Webb Space Telescope is unveiling the early universe with unprecedented clarity. Space exploration continues to inspire and push the boundaries of what humanity can achieve.
